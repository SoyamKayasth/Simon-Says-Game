A simple and interactive **Simon Says memory game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
The goal of the game is to remember and repeat the sequence of colors generated by the game.
With every correct round, the level increases and the sequence becomes longer, making the game more challenging.
The game tests your memory by generating a color sequence that the player must repeat correctly to progress through levels.

## 📌 Project Overview
Simon Says is a classic memory game where:

* The game flashes a sequence of colored buttons
* The player must repeat the same sequence in the correct order
* Each new level adds one more color to the sequence
* The game ends when the player makes a wrong move

This project focuses on **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and **basic game logic** in JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** – Structure of the game
* **CSS3** – Styling and button animations
* **JavaScript (ES6)** – Game logic and interactivity
